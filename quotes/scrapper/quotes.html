<p><quote>A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.</quote><context>�Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan� (March 1927), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 28.</context></p>
<p><quote>In the sphere of theory, destroy the roots of ultra-democracy. First, it should be pointed out that the danger of ultrademocracy lies in the fact that it damages or even completely wrecks the Party organization and weakens or even completely undermines the Party's fighting capacity, rendering the Party incapable of fulfilling its fighting tasks and thereby causing the defeat of the revolution. Next, it should be pointed out that the source of ultra-democracy consists in the petty bourgeoisie's individualistic aversion to discipline. When this characteristic is brought into the Party, i t develops into ultra-democratic ideas politically and organizationally. These ideas are utterly incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat.</quote><context>�On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party� (December 1929), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 108.</context></p>
<p><quote>Inner-Party criticism is a weapon for strengthening the Party organization and increasing its fighting capacity. In the Party organization of the Red Army, however, criticism is not always of this character, and sometimes turns into personal attack. As a result, it damages the Party organization as well as individuals. This is a manifestation of petty-bourgeois individualism. The method of correction is to help Party members understand that the purpose of criticism is to increase the Party's fighting capacity in order to achieve victory in the class struggle and that it should not be used as a means of personal attack.</quote><context>�On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party� (December 1929), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 110.</context></p>

<p><quote>If a man wants to succeed in his work, that is, to achieve the anticipated results, he must bring his ideas into correspondence with the laws of the objective external world; if they do not correspond, he will fail in his practice.

<p><quote>The Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism has two outstanding characteristics.

<p><quote>Knowledge begins with practice, and theoretical knowledge, which is acquired through practice, must then return to practice.

<p><quote>The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal; it lies in the contradictoriness within the thing. This internal contradiction exists in every single thing, hence its motion and development. Contradictoriness within a thing is the fundamental cause of its development, while its interrelations and interactions with other things are secondary causes.</quote><context>�On Contradiction,� (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 313.</context></p>
<p><quote>Changes in society are due chiefly to the development of the internal contradictions in society, that is, the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production, the contradiction between classes and the contradiction between the old and the new; it is the development of these contradictions that pushes society forward and gives the impetu6 for the suppression of the old society by the new.</quote><context>�On Contradiction,� (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 314.</context></p>
<p><quote>It [materialist dialectics] holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the basis of change, and that external causes become operative through internal causes.

<p><quote>Opposition and struggle between ideas of different kinds constantly occur within the Party; this is a reflection within the Party of contradictions between classes and between the new and the old in society.

<p><quote>If in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved.</quote><context>�On Contradiction,� (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 332.</context></p>
<p><quote>Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary. The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect that has gained the dominant position. But this situation is not static; the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other and the nature of the thing changes accordingly.</quote><context>�On Contradiction,� (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 333.</context></p>
<p><quote>While we recognize that in the general development of history the material determines the mental and social being determines social consciousness, we also - and indeed must - recognize the reaction of mental on material things, of social consciousness on social being and of the superstructure on the economic base. This does not go against materialism; on the contrary, it avoids mechanical materialism and firmly upholds dialectical materialism.</quote><context>�On Contradiction,� (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 336.</context></p>
<p><quote>Contradiction and struggle are universal and absolute, but the methods of resolving contradictions, that is, the forms of struggle, differ according to the differences in the nature of the contradictions.

<p><quote>Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; it is people, not things that are decisive.

<p><quote>History shows that wars are divided into two kinds, just and unjust. All wars that are progressive are just, and all wars that impede progress are unjust. We Communists oppose all unjust wars that impede progress, but we do not oppose progressive, just wars. Not only do we Communists not oppose just wars; we actively participate in them. As for unjust wars, World War I is an instance in which both sides fought for imperialist interests; therefore, the Communists of the whole world firmly opposed that war. The way to oppose a war of this kind is to do everything possible to prevent it before it breaks out and, once it breaks out, to oppose war with war, to oppose unjust war with just war, whenever possible.</quote><context>�On Protracted War� (May 1938), Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 150.</context></p>
<p><quote>In seeking victory, those who direct a war cannot overstep the limitations imposed by the objective conditions.

<p><quote>The intellectuals often tend to be subjective and individualistic, impractical in their thinking and irresolute in action until they have thrown themselves heart and soul into mass revolutionary struggles, or made up their minds to serve the interests of the masses and become one with them.

Some will drop out of the revolutionary ranks at critical moments and become passive, while a few may even become enemies of the revolution.

<p><quote>We have an army for fighting as well as an army for labour. For fighting, we have the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies but even they do a dual job, warfare and production. With these two kinds of armies, and with a fighting army skilled in these two tasks and in mass work, we can overcome our difficulties and defeat Japanese imperialism.</quote><context>�Get Organized!� (November 29, 1943), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 153.</context></p>

<p><quote>We Communists must be able to integrate ourselves with the masses in all things. If our Party members spend their whole lives sitting indoors and never go out to face the world and brave the storm, what good will they be to the Chinese people? None at all, and we do not need such people as Party members.

<p><quote>We should always use our brains and think everything over carefully. A common saying goes, �Knit your brows and you will hit upon a stratagem.� In other words much thinking yields wisdom.

<p><quote>All men must die, but death can vary in its significance. The ancient Chinese writer Szuma Chien said, �Though death befalls all men alike, it may be weightier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather.� To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather.</quote><context>�Serve the People� (September 8, 1944), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 227.</context></p>

<p><quote>Wherever there is struggle there is sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence.

<p><quote>It is up to us to organize the people. As for the reactionaries in China, it is up to us to organize the people to overthrow them.

<p><quote>The most fundamental method of work, which all Communists must firmly bear in mind, is to determine our working policies according to actual conditions.

<p><quote>There are people in our leading organs in some places that think that it is enough for the leaders alone to know the Party's policies and that there is no need to let the masses know them.

<p><quote>To be good at translating the Party's policy into action of the masses, to be good at getting not only the leading cadres but also the broad masses to understand and master every movement and every struggle we launch - this is an art of Marxist-Leninist leadership.

<p><quote>If we tried to go on the offensive when the masses are not yet awakened, that would be adventurism.

<p><quote>Our slogan in training troops is �Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and soldiers teach each other�. The fighters have a lot of practical combat experience.

<p><quote>If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party.

<p><quote>�Exchange information.� This means that members of a Party committee should keep each other informed and exchange views on matters that have come to their attention. This is of great importance in achieving a common language. Some fail to do so and, like the people described by Lao Tzu, �do not visit each other all their lives, though the crowing of their cocks and the barking of their dogs are within hearing of each other�. The result is that they lack a common language.</quote><context>�Methods of Work of Party Committees� (March 13, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 378.</context></p>
<p><quote>In all mass movements we must make a basic investigation and analysis of the number of active supporters, opponents and neutrals and must not decide problems subjectively and without basis.</quote><context>�Methods of Work of Party Committees� (March 13, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 380.</context></p>
<p><quote>Pay attention to uniting and working with comrades who differ with you. This should be borne in mind both in the localities and in the army.

<p><quote>Just because we have won victory, we must never relax our vigilance against the frenzied plots for revenge by the imperialists and their running dogs.

<p><quote>�Don't you want to abolish state power?� Yes, we do, but not right now. We cannot do it yet. Why? Because imperialism still exists, because domestic reaction still exists, because classes still exist in our country. Our present task is to strengthen the people's state apparatus - mainly the people's army, the people's police and the people's courts - in order to consolidate national defense and protect the people's interests.</quote><context>�On the People's Democratic Dictatorship� (June 30, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 418.</context></p>
<p><quote>The serious problem is the education of the peasantry. The peasant economy is scattered, and the socialization of agriculture, judging by the Soviet Union's experience, will require a long time and painstaking work. Without socialization of agriculture, there can be no complete, consolidated socialism.</quote><context>�On the People's Democratic Dictatorship� June 30, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 419.</context></p>
<p><quote>The People's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. For it is only the working class that is most far-sighted, most selfless and most thoroughly revolutionary. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class revolution fails and that with the leadership of the working class revolution triumphs.</quote><context>�On the People's Democratic Dictatorship� (June 30, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 421.</context></p>
<p><quote>The People's democratic dictatorship is based on the alliance of the working class, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and mainly on the alliance of the workers and the peasants, because these two classes comprise 80 to go per cent of China's population. These two classes are the main force in overthrowing imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The transition from New Democracy to socialism also depends mainly upon their alliance.</quote><context>�On the People's Democratic Dictatorship� (June 30, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 421.</context></p>
<p><quote>Taught by mistakes and setbacks, we have become wiser and handle our affairs better. It is hard for any political party or person to avoid mistakes, but we should make as few as possible.

<p><quote>Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history; such is the history of civilization for thousands of years.

<p><quote>Two types of social contradictions - those between ourselves and the enemy and those among the people themselves confront us. The two are totally different in their nature.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), first pocket ed.. p. 2.</context></p>
<p><quote>The contradictions between the enemy and us are antagonistic contradictions. Within the ranks of the people, the contradictions among the working people are non-antagonistic, while those between the exploited and the exploiting classes have a non-antagonistic aspect in addition to an antagonistic aspect.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), p. 3.</context></p>

<p><quote>Within the ranks of the people, democracy is correlative with centralism and freedom with discipline. They are the two opposites of a single entity, contradictory as well as united, and we should not one-sidedly emphasize one to the denial of the other. Within the ranks of the people, we cannot do without freedom, nor can we do without discipline; we cannot do without democracy, nor can we do without centralism. This unity of democracy and centralism, of freedom and discipline, constitutes our democratic centralism. Under this system, the people enjoy extensive democracy and freedom, but at the same time they have to keep within the bounds of socialist discipline.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., pp. 10-11.</context></p>
<p><quote>This democratic method of resolving contradictions among the people was epitomized in 1942 in the formula �unity, criticism, unity�. To elaborate, it means starting from the desire for unity, resolving contradictions through criticism or struggle and arriving at a new unity on a new basis. In our experience this is the correct method of resolving contradictions among the people.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 12.</context></p>
<p><quote>In ordinary circumstances, contradictions among the people are not antagonistic. However, if they are not handled properly, or if we relax our vigilance and lower our guard, antagonism may arise. In a socialist country, a development of this kind is usually only a localized and temporary phenomenon. The reason is that the system of exploitation of man by man has been abolished and the interests of the people are the same.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 14.</context></p>
<p><quote>Communists must use the democratic method of persuasion and education when working among the laboring people and must on no account resort to commandism or coercion. The Chinese Communist Party faithfully adheres to this Marxist-Leninist principle.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 15.</context></p>
<p><quote>Marxist philosophy holds that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law operates universally, whether in the natural world, in human society, or in man's thinking. Between the opposites in a contradiction there is at once unity and struggle, and it is this that impels things to move and change. Contradictions exist everywhere, but they differ in accordance with the different nature of different things. In any given phenomenon or thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary and transitory, and hence relative, whereas the struggle of opposites is absolute.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 18.</context></p>

<p><quote>By over-all planning, we mean planning which takes into consideration the interests of the 600 million people of our country.

<p><quote>Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend is the policy for promoting the progress of the arts and the sciences and a flourishing socialist culture in our land. Different forms and styles in art should develop freely and different schools in science should contend freely. We think that it is harmful to the growth of art and science if administrative measures are used to impose one particular style of art or school of thought and to ban another. Questions of right and wrong in the arts and sciences should be settled through free discussion in artistic and scientific circles and through practical work in these fields. They should not be settled in summary fashion.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., pp. 49-50.</context></p>

<p><quote>Now, there are two different attitudes towards learning from others. One is the dogmatic attitude of transplanting everything, whether or not it is suited to our conditions. This is no good. The other attitude is to use our heads and learn those things that suit our conditions, that is, to absorb whatever experience is useful to us. That is the attitude we should adopt.</quote><context>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People, (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 75.</context></p>
<p><quote>Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the skies? No. Are they innate in the mind? No. They come from social practice and from it alone.

<p><quote>Often, correct knowledge can be arrived at only after many repetitions of the process leading from matter to consciousness and then back to matter, that is, leading from practice to knowledge and then back to practice.
